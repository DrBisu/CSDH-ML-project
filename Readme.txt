Predicting acceptance into neurosurgery in patients with chronic subdural hematomaâ€™s (CSDH) using a deep learning algorithm.

We have created a multi-level perceptron artificial neural network that takes in 10 input variables to predict whether a patient's referral should be accepted or rejected.

We trained the model on a train, validation, test split on around 500 input data sets and achieved an accuracy of 96%.

The model is continuously being trained and improved behind the scenes and thus any and all feedback from physicians is appreciated.

All the source code is available upon request.
